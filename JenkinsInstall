// Create first admin user

Create the first admin user by filling out the form on this screen, then click Save and Finish.

$JENKINS_HOME directory

JENKINS_HOME refers to the Jenkins home directory, located in the ~/.jenkins directory by default. 
This location is where all the important data for Jenkins and its build goes. 
By default, it can be set either as a system property or an environment variable and can be verified from the system config page.

 //Post-Installation wizard

The post-installation wizard takes you through a few quick initial configuration steps that are required before you can view the Jenkins Home Page:

    Bring up a web browser and go to the http://<myServer>:8080 URL. Replace <myServer> with the name of the system running Jenkins.

//Install Jenkins upgrades

To install a Jenkins upgrade:

    Right-click on changelog in the alert panel to open the changelog for this release. Read this to be aware of changes this upgrade could make to your system.

    Click download to download the upgrade software.

    Use the Manage Jenkins  Prepare for Shutdown link to initiate a graceful shutdown of Jenkins.

    Replace the jenkins.war file on your system with the new file.

        On Linux systems, this is located in the /usr/share/jenkins directory by default.

    Restart Jenkins to apply the upgrade.
    

// Select Manage Jenkins  Global Tool Configuration to configure the tools used for Pipeline development.
